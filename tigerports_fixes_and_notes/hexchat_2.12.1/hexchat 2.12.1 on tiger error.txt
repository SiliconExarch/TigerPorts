hexchat 2.12.1 on Tiger error

during fetch:

can't download the source due to outdated MacPorts SSL infrastruction on < 10.6
-add note regarding how to fetch source manually


during configure stage:

autoconf identifies system as accepting -fPIE

configure:19164: result: no
configure:19136: checking whether C compiler accepts -fPIE
configure:19155: /opt/local/bin/gcc-apple-4.2 -c -pipe -Os -arch i386 -funsigned-char  -fPIE -I/opt/local/include conftest.c >&5
configure:19155: $? = 0
configure:19164: result: yes


but this still fails in compilation on 10.4:

libtool: link: /opt/local/bin/gcc-apple-4.2 -pipe -Os -arch i386 -funsigned-char -fPIE -fPIC -Wall -Wextra -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-pointer-sign -Wno-missing-field-initializers -Werror=format-security -Werror=init-self -Werror=declaration-after-statement -Werror=missing-include-dirs -Werror=implicit-function-declaration -Werror=pointer-arith -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names -arch i386 -o make-te make-te.o  -L/opt/local/lib /opt/local/lib/libintl.dylib
ld: -pie can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later


- interim solution - pull it out of the Makefile manually:

post-configure {
     reinplace "s|-fPIE||g" ${worksrcpath}/Makefile
     reinplace "s|-fPIE||g" ${worksrcpath}/src/common/Makefile
}




======================================

backend.m has incompatible ObjC code. Even if <10.9 patch is applied, and uptime is fixed, still get this:

AutoLoad failed for: /opt/local/lib/hexchat/plugins/sysinfo.so
 dlopen(/opt/local/lib/hexchat/plugins/sysinfo.so, 10): Symbol not found: _objc_enumerationMutation
   Referenced from: /opt/local/lib/hexchat/plugins/sysinfo.so
   Expected in: dynamic lookup
   

- so disable sysinfo on Tiger (again)

configure.args-append --disable-sysinfo
